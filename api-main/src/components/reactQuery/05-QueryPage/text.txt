 placeholderData: keepPreviousData,

    By setting `placeholderData` to `keepPreviousData`, we ensure that
    React Query will keep the previous data in the cache while it fetches
    the new data. This means that if the user navigates from page 1 to page 2,
    the data from page 1 will remain in the cache until the new data from page 2
    is received. This helps to prevent a ** flash ** of "no data" while the new data
    is being fetched.
